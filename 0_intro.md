# Introduction

I recently bought a used Winther Cargo e-bike off of Facebook Marketplace. It was sold cheaply with damanged connector. I eventually found out that it was the display connector.
As I kept playing with this e-bike I learned a lot of things about the controller, e-bike controllers in general and some cool new things in this space. My goal here is to document the knowledge that I gained about this e-bike system and document the journey of converting this old e-bike to VESC.

## How it all started
As I said, I bought this used Winther Cargo e-bike on Facebook Marketplace. The seller stated that it stopped working one day and the pictures showed one damaged cable connector. I figured I'll replace the connector and the bike will start working again. This assumtion turned out to be almost completely correct. I replaced the cable and the bike became functional again, not 100% functional as I hoped but ridable.
